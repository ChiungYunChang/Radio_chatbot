Ariana Grande,Focus (Meaning),the first line of 'focus' is 'i know what i came to do and that ain't gonna change' what i came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love to share to listen to improve to learn to share music to share experience to share feelings to make people feel happy and empowered she explained  to make people feel like they're not alone without using my voice to do those things i would feel empty she continued when i say 'focus on me' i'm not asking to be the center of attention i'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice by 'focus on me' i literally mean focus on me focus on what i'm all about and what i believe in  the more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like what we're wearing our gender our hairstyle our sexuality the color of our skin but focus on each other on a soul level the more we realize how much we have in common the more we listen to each other the more one we become  the title of ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her too since she's had such a tumultuous year ahem remember the donut incident but she insists this is about all of us  you judge because you don't focus on me you don't focus on each other she explained you judge because you focus on appearance on clothes you focus on what you want from me what you want from people how you want them to wear their hair you judge me you wanna see me dressed a certain way how you wanna see their makeup their eyebrows you focus on what you think people should be like for you but when you stop and you actually focus on someone you'll see the light in them when you focus on me you see the light in me when we focus on each other we see the light in each other and even if you don't this is who we are what are we making fun of what's there to make fun of we should apologize for that,0.011,0.001,0.001,0.01,0.193,0.003,0.01,0.003,0.003,0.007,0.009,0.001,0.001,0.007,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.005,0.005,0.001,0.012,0.001,0.089,0.001,0.0,0.001,0.008,0.75

Ariana Grande,Open Letter Critiquing Sexism,being empowered is not the same as being a bitch having something to say is not the same as having a bad attitude  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you i have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because i have come to the realization that i have so much more to talk about i'm currently making the best music i've ever made in my life having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people i've ever known working my ass off every single day performing  creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day  i come from a long bloodline of female activists my aunt judy was the first italian american female president of the national press club in washington dc i think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled after black power women's liberation and 46 years later we're still not quite there yet if a women has a lot of sex or any sex for that matter she's a slut if a man has sex he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used bitcheshoes how lovely he's had he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated  celebrated aww shiiit he smashed  i know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating  married to  attached to having sex with or not  seen with but by their value as an individual  i want the people reading this to know that they are more than enough on their own i want the media to please help me with this please support each other i'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like i constantly had to have a boy by my side after being on my own now for a few months i am realizing that that's just not the case i have never felt more present grounded and satisfied i've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more  one more thought my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as i can with my fans that is something i have done since day one and never plan on changing it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny special personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things i've done  things i'm going through i don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before i love y'all with all my heart you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me  any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke she will need her sisterhood  gloria steinem,0.001,0.004,0.063,0.28,0.035,0.007,0.01,0.004,0.003,0.045,0.49,0.043,0.009,0.001,0.003,0.002,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.001,0.005,0.001,0.019,0.002,0.002,0.004,0.003,0.217

Billie Eilish,Paparazzi Instagram Monologue,so i just wanted to say something real quick which is yesterday i was at?kimmel?which was amazing?and when i left i had?to go to a rehearsal so to walk to the car there was an alley that i walked through like 500 feet to my left was a group of fans and then like 500 feet to my right was what i thought was fans and paparazzi  i started i went to the left side i walked all the way over to them and hugged them all i took pictures and talked to them for a second didn't sign anything because i like don't do that that's something i don't do because i used to and i realised all anyone did was sell everything that i signed so i stopped doing that it's kind of a policy of mine that i don't  so i talked to them hugged them all i went to the other side and as i got closer like they were cheering for me and stuff and shouting for my name and stuff and so i walked  and as i got closer i kind of realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and ebayers which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn't give less of a fuck about me at all  but i didn't want to like be disrespectful at all so i went up to them all and i like tried to get like hugs and try to touch all of their hands like do that down the line or whatever and i started to do that nobody put their hands out nobody tried to hug me backi hugged one girl at the end and so she was really sweet  but then i tried to walk like a couple feet across from where they were not where the first group was but like in the same area that i was in because i thought that's where there were fans  when i looked over there they were gone and i was like ok well i guess nobody here really wants anything from me besides a fucking autograph which i don't do because these bitches will sell that shit  like i'll sign something if it's like for a special occasion or if somebody's in need or whatever of course i'm gonna do that but i have this whole thing about not signing things because i just want to be there i'd way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fucking sign something so you can sell that shit  i don't do that and i've tried to make that clear like a billion times  and i said it before i went over to them  anyway  i started to walk away because i realised none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person um and so i walked away  as i started to walk away back to the car they all started to boo me  and then they all started calling me a little bitch and saying i'm gonna lose my grammy nominations and you know what a little fucking you know whatever just cursing me out and shit  damn dude like  then i started hearing them comparing they kept being like lorde would have stopped i'm like i did stop i walked 500 fe i walked like 000 feet to come say hi to you and give some hugs and y'all are booing me and calling me a little bitch  like the fact that people can switch up like that clicks fingersdamn like wait outside for you and then immediately they don't get what they want and they boo you and fucking curse at you  i'm like bro i'm 7 you're  oh my god this shit isexasperated whoo i turned around ready to fucking pounce and then i got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction which is probably good and it's probably stupid dumb of me making these videos but  mmanyway the only reason i'm making this video is because i saw a video of this all happening and i just wanted to clarify what actually happened because if you watch the video it literally looks like i'm watching by a bunch of fans and like completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them which is not at all what happened  i literally walked from the other side of the alley which was like 000 feet which is fine i'm like happy to do it but i walked over there literally only to say hi only to hug people i literally went over and i was like i don't want pictures i want to hug and i got pictures of me shoved into my fucking face and no love whatsoever  so i left and then i got booed and got called a little bitch and got told that i'm gonna lose my grammys  i probably am gonna lose the grammys but it's okay though i'm not worried about that it's the nomination that counts  anyway i don't know i just wanted to i don't even knowi went back to the other side where the real fans were and i was like guys they booed me and they were very sweet you guys are my friends i love you a lot  and to the grown men that booed me and called me a little bitch i hope the best for you i hope you can find someone else you can use to make money off of and belittle so yeah all the best  love you paparazzi,0.601,0.013,0.002,0.007,0.034,0.003,0.095,0.531,0.007,0.006,0.01,0.004,0.005,0.072,0.003,0.007,0.002,0.02,0.023,0.002,0.02,0.004,0.017,0.005,0.003,0.002,0.129,0.034

Taylor Swift,Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute),i'm curled up in my mother's bed staring intently at my laptop i'm watching a video of a familiarlooking man wearing a black tuxedo the video seems to be of a televised award show the tape is grainy but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear  now i'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand her voice is full like solid gold with some platinum blended in sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes but gold is brenda's metal in this song i wish i'd wrote ladies and gentlemen brenda lee  the camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties the music starts and she's looking down at a framed picture she's at ease she is theatrical and she is beautiful in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye lights camera action she starts to sing that's when you hear the gold and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand the performance ends and the crowd goes wild the lovely lady graciously takes a bow she smiles out into the vast darkness taking it all in with grace and composure the video ends and i reflect back on what i just saw it was a timeless performance but here are the facts the year is 98 the song is someone loves you honey the man in the tuxedo is johnny cash and the woman in the beautiful dress with the honeylike voice is none other than brenda lee  brenda lee who was born in 944 near atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father brenda lee the little girl who took over the music world with charttopping hits when she was still a child brenda lee the woman who ushered in a new style of rock  roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television brenda lee the artist who later went back to her country roots proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under brenda lee the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her  i watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause there's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years brenda lee is grace brenda lee is class and composure and when she hears the roar of a crowd brenda lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation brenda lee is someone i will always look up to because of the way she shines as johnny cash said in 98 it's almost like she's golden,0.008,0.047,0.007,0.02,0.022,0.004,0.014,0.014,0.008,0.006,0.002,0.005,0.003,0.032,0.014,0.001,0.002,0.03,0.005,0.005,0.005,0.002,0.043,0.002,0.001,0.008,0.04,0.706
